# phlex

Learns your coding habits and makes development much easier and automated, allowing you to focus on being creative in your coding and NOT getting disrupted with easy things such as setting up your project from scratch. phlex learns how you structure your projects and it basically lets you create a new project from scratch with just a new name for the project. Perfect tool for developing crossplatform applications for your big next multi-cloud application.
